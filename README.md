## UX project

The main objectiv here was to learn how to the devellop a concept of  User interface answering a given issue. The issue was : " How to strengthen the family bonds "
Then followed up a whole UX design process:

while( the solution isnt found ){

- Understand and specify the context
- Specify the needs of the user and our team
- Propose a solution of concept
- evaluate how the solution is from the requierements

A badly made UX is usualy simply made from expectations of the programmer/company.
A well made UX is done in accordance with the targeted users feedback , interviews ...
